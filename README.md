## Overview
This workflow is used to analysis shRNA-seq and CRISPR/cas9 genetic screens. It uses edgeR to perform data processing, quality control, differential expression analysis, and gene set testing, with batch correction implemented. 
## Installation

Install snakemake using the mamba package manager

```bash
$ mamba create -c conda-forge -c bioconda -n snakemake snakemake

$ mamba activate snakemake
```
    
Pull the workflow to your project directory
```bash
$ git pull https://github.com/zifornd/Bioinformatics-Internship
```
    
## Usage

Configure the workflow by editing the `config.yaml` file:

```console
$ nano config/config.yaml
```

Run the workflow: 

```console
$ snakemake --use-conda --cores 1
```
For further details on Snakemake, see the [Snakemake documentation](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

## Documentation
